   My dad is my hero because how hard he works and how much he sacrficies for our family.
</li>
<li>
  When my dad came to this country in 1996 he didn't have much. He worked numerous jobs and has a story about something
  that happening at work all over NJ and NY. He studied very hard and worked his butt off. He is thankfull everyday and doesn't forget
  to mention to thankgod for everything we have.
</li>
<li> I want to follow in his footsteps so I can take care of my family and be successful like him
