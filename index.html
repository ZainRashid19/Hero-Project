  When my dad came to this country in 19__ he didn't have much. He worked numerous jobs and has a story about something
  that happening at work all over NJ and NY. He studied very hard and worked his butt off. He is thankfull everyday and doesn't forget
  to mention to thankgod for everything we have.
